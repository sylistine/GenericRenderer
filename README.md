# GenericRenderer
A vulkan-based renderer and game engine research project.
## Purpose
The intent of this project is to become more adept with vulkan, modern graphics concepts, and to create a playground with which to explore shading models and techniques such as PBR shading, subsurface scattering, etc.
It has already become a useful playground for exploring the many ways software can or should be architected in C++, and will eventually pivot into a platform for making games and spatial (AR/VR) applications.
It should eventually become a way to sharpen my expertise with libraries are common for video games (math libraries, audio SDKs, XR SDKs), and other related technologies such as tile-preserving subpasses in Vulkan, fragment density maps that determine tile resolution, and more mobile platform concepts.
## Dependencies
Current:
- Vulkan
- GLM
Projected:
- FMOD/Wwise/OpenAL
